# US centricity

A series of prompts which could be used to assess the extent to which large language models exhibit what could broadly be called a American centric world view by virtue of the fact that the majority of training data they might have been exposed to, or at least a disproportionate amount, may have originated in the United States of America. 

Evaluation prompts might use strategies where a large language model that has had a hypothetical equal input of text from all parts of the English speaking world might have responded differently as opposed to a model that had been trained on a disproportionate amount of US centric texts.
