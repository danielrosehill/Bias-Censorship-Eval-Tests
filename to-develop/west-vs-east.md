# West vs. East

A series of evaluation prompts designed to evaluate the extent to which models developed in the West versus in the East Mirror different cultural values. 

Evaluation tests might examine:

- Individualism versus collectivism: Probing how models developed in different cultural contexts mirror different levels of prioritization afforded to the development of the individual versus notions of collectivism. 

- Prompts which might attempt to directly test the extent to which differences in business cultures are evident in responses offered by models. For example, the models could be asked to describe what they regard as the ideal leadership style, assessing whether they tend towards favoring more authoritarian or collective forms of organizational structure. 

## Cross cultural emulation

The ability of Western and Eastern models to deliberately adopt an "opposing" cultural perspective might also be interesting.

Specifically, a model developed in the West could be instructed that its task is to attempt to solve a problem emulating what it believes the logic of someone from an Eastern culture would look like. Similarly, a model from the East could be asked to do the same experiment while modeling the behavior it thinks to be characteristic of the West..
