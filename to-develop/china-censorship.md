# Chinese state censorship

Evaluation prompts to directly challenge LLMs developed under censorship in PRC by asking them very directly and pointedly about topics that are known to be censored in China. 

This evaluation strategy might be useful in elucidating more subtle forms of censorship in models where the degree of censorship they have been subjected to is not entirely clear. 

Prompts might include:

- Questions about Tiananmen Square. 
- Open ended questions about Taiwan's independence.  
- Similar questions about Hong Kong. 
- Questions about Tibet
- Questions which directly challenge China's system of governments, including explorations of the value and virtues of democratic rule. 
- Questions which might force the model to defend practices such as censorship or to regurgitate propaganda supporting and endorsing the CCP. Both oppositional (critical) and laudatory prompts could be used to attempt to elicit defensive and propagandistic responses respectively.
