# Bias & Censorship Evaluation Prompts

The purpose of this Github repository is to gather together a few notes and test prompts used to attempt to gain ballpark assessments of the level of censorship in various large language models. 

Several questions interest me when it comes to considering the extent to which large language models can become biased in ways that are not immediately obvious. 

The first is the extent to which the selection of training data, even when that selection is fairly non-discriminatory, passes on the cultural biases that might be inherent in the culture from which the majority of that training data is derived.  

I'm interested particularly in the question of the extent to which the general American-centric nature of the English- speaking internet skews models towards American-centric worldviews and in particular towards political leanings popular among specific demographics who may be overrepresented in the source material that makes its way into scraped web material gathered and aggregated in crawls.

Secondly, I'm interested in exploring the question of how models created in non-Western contexts and operating under degrees of censorship respond to specific prompts challenging the worldview of those they are censored by.

Finally, a question that I think would be fascinating to explore: how Western and Eastern large language models approach the world differently through inheriting the wider cultural lens of the cultures from which they emerge. I am interested in the idea that developing a rounded understanding of this question could inform practical decision-making in the form of choosing the optimal instructional model for specific use cases.

To emphasize: while I love reading the fascinating literature documenting experiments that have sought to answer these and similar questions, I share these little personal experiments merely as notes for the curious and out of a personal conviction in the value of open-sourcing information. 

In sharing these, I am not operating under any illusion that these can be construed as any kind of substitute for the kind of properly designed experiments needed to test these hypotheses with scientific rigor and precision. Rather, they're intended as lighterweight and less formal attempts at probing the very surface of these topics.
